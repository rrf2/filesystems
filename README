Our file system utilizes a cache that is structured as a hashmap. To add/remove items we created auxillary functions.
The iolib sends messages to the file system. The main() function in the file system then decides which function to call (_Open, _Create, etc.) depending on the message type received. When the behavior is unexpected, our file system returns ERROR.
